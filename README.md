# FinSplit - Split bills without hussle

## The problem FinSplit solves

### 💡 Inspiration

-   We live in a hostel, and we need to split almost all our expenses on a daily basis. We started to realise that this lack of structure led to unpredictable spending that was hard to keep track of as a result of the infinite costs, we incurred each month and the inability to keep track of who was paying for what and when. So we came up with FinSPlit to make things easier to manage and save time.

### 💻 What it does

1. Create a Group for the weekend plan.
2. You paid for the anything. Keep a track of it.
3. How much has the group spent in total?
4. Find out how much you owe/are owed.
5. Looks like you have to pay multiple people. Is there a way to combine payments in the group?
6. Settle up in the group

### ⚒️ Technologies

1. Node.js (Typescript)
2. React.js (Typescript)
3. MongoDB
4. AWS S3 Bucket

### 🐞 Challenges we ran into
- It was challenging for us to put up security measures to safeguard user information from unauthorized users, as well as CORS policies to let authorized users access to our API endpoints.
- Using a jsonwebtoken for authorization was a bit typical for us as we were trying out this method for the first time.

### 😎 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We found solutions to issues that actually exist in the world and affect us in our daily lives.
- We are providing End to End Encryption to the user's data.
- We completed the app within timeline

### 🧠 What we learned
- We learned how to secure our API Endpoints for security mechanism and data privacy.
- We learned how we can encrypt and validate users' personal data with the help of crypto package provided by Node.js
- We learned how to analyze the charts on the basis of our daily expenses and how to integrate it in React.js.

### ✨ What's next for FinSplit
- Creating the app's own crypto currency and making a single click settlement within app.
