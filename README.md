# FinSplit - Split bills without hussle

## The problem FinSplit solves

### üí° Inspiration

-   The survey shows the share of adults turning to payment apps for bill-splitting at least once a week was highest in the 18-to-25 age group (60%), followed by the 26-to-41 group (58%).
-   Because of the endless expenses every month and the lack of a system to keep track of who‚Äôs paying for what and when (solely relying on memory), We began to realise that such a system led to erratic expenditure which was difficult to keep track of.
-   This inspired us to create a functional application that would be able to help those struggling with anxiety in their day-to-day life.
-   According to experts, users frequently lose track of who they gave money to, occupy their minds with other thoughts, and find themselves more anxious.
-   Therefore, we are attempting to create an app to assist individuals in living stress-free lives. FinSplit is a bill splitting option that may enable friends and family members who share everyday activities split costs.

### üíª What it does

1. Create a Group for the weekend plan.
2. You paid for the anything. Keep a track of it.
3. How much has the group spent in total?
4. Find out how much you owe/are owed.
5. Looks like you have to pay multiple people. Is there a way to combine payments in the group?
6. Settle up in the group

### ‚öíÔ∏è Technologies

1. Node.js
2. React.js
3. MongoDB
4. AWS S3 Bucket

### üêû Challenges we ran into

-   Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project by a deadline.
-   As we are new to fintech, we face problems in getting the content properly with minimum lag.
-   For developing the Split Bill concept was time-consuming as we are new to this problem statement but having large set of resources for Node.js and React.js was a bit easier.
